# Facebook-Analyzer

Pulls and saves data from the Facebook Graph api about a specified group. Then returns stats about user activity and other various meta data. I made this to analyze data about the UCBMFET page but never got around to implementing all the analysis features aside from a couple general ones nor to publishing the results. Perhaps one day in the future when I have more time I will finish time, with better data structures and coding practices.
